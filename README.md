# Foodality
Foodality is a next-gen food discovery app, similar to Yelp, but with smarter recommendations. Instead of generic results, we use user data to filter and recommend restaurants that best fit your preferences. Whether you’re revisiting an old favorite or looking for new hidden gems, Foodality curates the best spots just for you.

## ✨ Core Features
🏠 Home – A mix of restaurants you've visited before + new recommended spots.<br>
📍 Discover New Restaurants – A Tinder-like swipe interface to explore new restaurants.<br>
✍️ Create – Add reviews & ratings for every restaurant you visit.<br>
👤 Profile – View your past visits, bio, and settings.<br>
🔔 Notifications – Get updates on deals, new reviews, and restaurant recommendations.<br>
